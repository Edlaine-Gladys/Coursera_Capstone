# Coursera_Capstone
Final exam of Coursera

This project consists of exploring, segmenting and grouping neighborhoods in the city of Toronto based on the postal code and neighborhood information.

It was divided into 3 stages:


Part   | Stages
--------- | ------
 1|  Webscraping 
 2  |Geolocation of Toronto neighborhoods
3 | Cluster

1. For Toronto neighborhood data, there is a Wikipedia page that contains all the information we need to explore and group Toronto neighborhoods. You will be asked to scrape the Wikipedia page and organize the data, clean it up and then read it on a pandas dataframe.

 
2. With a csv file with the latitude and longitude coordinates of each neighborhood, we will unite the location data frame with what is in the names of the Toronto city neighborhoods.

3. Explore and group Toronto's neighborhoods.
